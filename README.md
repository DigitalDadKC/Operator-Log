# Operator-Log

I completed this for a previous employer. It's an automated password-protected logsheet for plant operators that features userforms with initialization, vlookups, spin buttons, loops, and list boxes. It gets backed up weekly and monthly via data server.

Anything noteworthy belongs in the logbook. Especially handy for 24-hour facilities.

<h3>Same with pump changes, chemical changes must be recorded as well</h3>
