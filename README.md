# Operator-Log

I completed this for a previous employer. It's an automated password-protected logsheet for plant operators that features userforms with initialization, vlookups, spin buttons, loops, and list boxes. It gets backed up weekly and monthly via data server.

<h4>Anything noteworthy belongs in the logbook. Especially handy for 24-hour facilities.</h4>

<h4>When pumps are changed, they must be recorded in the Pump Change Log</h4>

<h4>Same with pump changes, chemical changes must be recorded as well</h4>
